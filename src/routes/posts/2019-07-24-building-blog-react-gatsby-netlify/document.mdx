## Five steps to create your individual blog and five more to stand out

In the next few minutes I am going to walk you through the process of how I created this very blog that you are reading. Except for the actual domain name, everything comes free and is super easy to add to your blog.

Make it your own:

- Step 1 - Running create-react-blog
- Step 2 - Selecting fonts with Google Fonts
- Step 3 - Selecting colors with coolors.co
- Step 4 - Adding icons with Fontello
- Step 5 - Creating your own favicon

Stand out:

- Step 6 - Making your blog interactive

### Step 1 - Running create-react-blog

More and more content creators are moving away from Medium to their own, privately hosted blogs. With [create-your-own](https://github.com/frontarm/create-react-blog) has never been easier to create your own blog:

```javascript
npx create-react-blog react-blog
cd react-blog
npm start
```

It is going to look something like this:

With just a few more commands you can deploy that blog to Netlify:

```javascript
npm run build
npm run serve
npm run deploy:prod
```

### Step 2 - Selecting fonts with Google Fonts

By now almost every other website is running on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). For me it was important to not have more than two different fonts. One serif and one sans-serif. Just browse the most popular fonts and make sure your font of choice has a regular, italic and bold option.

### Step 3 - Selecting colors with coolors.co

You are not creative? You do not know what color goes with what color? Not a problem. Just browse the most popular color palettes on [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/browser/best/1):

### Step 4 - Adding icons with Fontello

Every blog needs icons. Get social media icons or any other icons on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). Download their bundle and add it to your repository.

### Step 5 - Creating your own favicon

If you do not have a great idea for your favicon, just take your initials or your two most favorite letters. [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) lets you generate your own favicon.

### Step 6 - Making your blog interactive

Blogs are all about community. You need to allow your readers to comment on your content. If you are planning on publishing a technical blog, chances are high that your readers have a Github account. There is this awesome Github app called [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/). It lets you connect your blog to a Github repository. On every new blog entry it will create a new issue in that repository. Every comment on that issue will appear in your blog and vice versa. This blog is connected to this repository: [https://github.com/Amberlamps/alexander-behrens-dev](https://github.com/Amberlamps/alexander-behrens-dev).
